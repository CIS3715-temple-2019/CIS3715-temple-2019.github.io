Print the confusion matrix. Report the accuracy on the training set. Discuss if you are seeing any difference and why. Compare the accurracy with the accuracy you got with kNN. Report on the size of the resulting tree (how many nodes are there and what is the depth of the tree). Visualize the tree (consider using `sklearn.tree.export_graphviz`).\n",

Experiment with `criterion` (default is `gini`, try to train using `entropy`), `max_depth` (try to set it to 2, 3, 4), `min_samples_leaf` (default is 1, try with 5, 15). See if you can find a combination of parameters that improves accuracy on the test set. Report what you found."

Then, you will need to decide what to do with the categorical attributes. The easiest is to simply ignore them, but it would reduce your accuracy. A better way (you have to try it) is to convert the categorical attributes to numbers. It is up to you to decide what distance measure to use, how to pick `k`, and make any other decision that will help you increase the accuracy. For example, it might help you to scale the attributes to the same range. Remember that any transformation you do on the training data needs to be repeated on the test data.

Given your best decision tree and kNN classifiers, what is the expected profit on your test data? Can you try to train another classifier that would have even larger profit?"
